1. Relative NTAs for all children should be at the same level.
	- model should enforce this. RelativeNTA should have a list of percentages for each stock.
	  date and parent at the top level only
	  update should be for all child stocks for that date

	- query should still get a single percentage

	- repository should remain how it is for updating by id (check that delete options make sense!)
	  update by object needs to update all children
	  
        - get ?

2. Remaining model tests for NTA.

3. Corporate Action Repository

4. Fix test app to remove access to the stock repository
